- This is an implementation of a Decision Tree which utilizes the ID3 algorithm.
- The dataset this model is implemented on is the Titanic dataset and a toy dataset Play Tennis
  - My Decision Tree classifies whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not given attributes of all passengers
  - My Decision Tree also classifies whether or not you should play tennis given certain attributes of the day
